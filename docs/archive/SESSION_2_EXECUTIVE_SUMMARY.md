## 🎓 KEY INSIGHTS

### What We Learned

1. **Socket.IO v4 Compatibility**
   - Issue: Default import no longer works
   - Solution: Use named export `{ Server }`
   - Lesson: Always verify library documentation

2. **Real-Time Implementation Gap**
   - Status: Partially implemented (31% true real-time)
   - Root Cause: Fallback to Math.random()
   - Solution: Replace with proper error handling

3. **Data Integrity Concerns**
   - Issue: Synthetic data presented as real
   - Risk: Misleads users and stakeholders
   - Solution: Add demo mode indicator

4. **Importance of Clear Planning**
   - Benefit: Detailed plan reduces implementation time
   - Code examples: Prevent errors during coding
   - Timeline: Realistic estimates improve delivery
